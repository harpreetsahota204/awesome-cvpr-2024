üß® Diffusion,ViewDiff: 3D-Consistent Image Generation with Text-to-Image Models,"Lukas H√∂llein,Alja≈æ Bo≈æiƒç, Norman M√ºller ",https://github.com/facebookresearch/ViewDiff,https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01807,lukashoel.github.io/viewdiff,"ViewDiff generates 3D-consistent images from different viewpoints of the same object or scene. The approach involves enhancing the U-Net architecture of pretrained text-to-image models with new layers, training on real-world multi-view datasets using a denoising process, and producing multi-view consistent images of the same object in a single forward denoising pass. The results show high visual quality with improved 3D consistency compared to existing methods."
üß© Segmentation,Amodal Ground Truth and Completion in the Wild,"Guanqi Zhan, Chuanxia Zheng, Weidi Xie",https://github.com/Championchess/Amodal-Completion-in-the-Wild,https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2312.17247,https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/amodal/,"The paper introduces amodal image segmentation which predicts masks for entire objects, including occluded parts. Previous methods used manual annotation, but the authors use 3D data to construct the MP3D-Amodal dataset with authentic amodal ground truth masks.  Two architecture variants are explored: a two-stage OccAmodal model and a one-stage SDAmodal model. Their method achieves state-of-the-art performance on amodal segmentation datasets, including COCOA and the new MP3D-Amodal dataset."
